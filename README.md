#### Intro
see https://github.com/woltapp/summer2019

#### Requirements and installation
Python 3.6
-Jupyter 1.0.0
-Folium 0.7.0
-Pandas 0.24.1
Requirements are located in requirements.txt file, which can be installed with pip install -r requirements.txt.
After installing requirements, run jupyter with `jupyter notebook` inside the project folder. After jupyter hub opens, open `pickup times.ipynb`, where the code is located. Here the code can be tested.

#### Walktrough
To run the program, you must run all the jupyter code blocks in correct order, starting with the import block, after which the datetime filter block can be used. Input the required data here in correct format, and proceed to third and final block.

The most of the data processing is done on the third block. Simply run the block and a map is displayed with the median time, and a csv file is written on the folder.
